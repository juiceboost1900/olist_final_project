`silver_shortcut.sl_*`\n","- Gold notebooks must **NOT** read from:\n","  - `sl_dev_*`\n","- Gold notebooks must **NOT** write back to Silver.\n","\n","This guardrail ensures Gold development and validation are based on\n","stable, promoted Silver data only, even though `sl_dev_*` tables may\n","still be visible via schema shortcuts during development.\n","\n","## Inputs (Read-only)\n","Gold outputs produced by Hon Boon:\n","- `dim_date`\n","- `dim_seller`\n","- `fact_seller_daily_perf`\n","\n","Reference baseline (Sprint 1 parity comparison):\n","- Sprint 1 Gold table(s) in `lh_olist_shared` (read-only)\n","  -

`dim_seller` unique by `seller_id`\n","\n","### B) Fact grain and uniqueness\n","- `fact_seller_daily_perf` must be unique by (`seller_id`, `order_date`)\n","\n","### C) Relationship checks (no exploding joins)\n","- Join `fact → dim_seller` should keep row count the same\n","- Join `fact → dim_date` should keep row count the same\n","- If row count increases, it indicates a broken key or non-unique dimension\n","\n","### D) Metric parity vs Sprint 1 Gold\n","- Re-aggregate fact totals (orders, items, revenue, GMV, etc.)\n","- Compare totals against Sprint 1 Gold totals\n","- Differences indicate upstream duplication, filtering, or logic drift\n","\n","## Expected Outcome\n","- All checks pass\n","- We are confident to promote Gold tables and connect the semantic model + BI\n","\n","## Ownership\n","- Janson owns this notebook.\n","- Others may open for viewing, but should not edit without coordination (auto-save risk).\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"cc639eda-5697-483a-a762-2830c72b9d13"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["-- ================================================\n","-- Validation check for dim tables duplicate values\n","-- ================================================\n","\n","SELECT 'dim_date' AS table_name, COUNT(DISTINCT date_key) AS distinct_keys, COUNT(*) AS total_rows\n","FROM dim_date\n","UNION ALL\n","SELECT 'dim_customer', COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), COUNT(*) FROM dim_customer\n","UNION ALL\n","SELECT 'dim_product', COUNT(DISTINCT product_id), COUNT(*) FROM dim_product\n","UNION ALL\n","SELECT 'dim_seller', COUNT(DISTINCT seller_id), COUNT(*) FROM dim_seller\n","UNION ALL\n","SELECT 'dim_order', COUNT(DISTINCT order_id), COUNT(*) FROM dim_order\n","UNION ALL\n","SELECT 'dim_payment', COUNT(DISTINCT payment_type), COUNT(*) FROM dim_payment;"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.livy.statement-meta+json":{"spark_pool":null,"statement_id":4,"statement_ids":[4],"state":"finished","livy_statement_state":"available","session_id":"0b273384-f17d-4752-99bf-512d72b5e0f6","normalized_state":"finished","queued_time":"2026-02-03T02:38:54.9287964Z","session_start_time":null,"execution_start_time":"2026-02-03T02:38:54.9300002Z","execution_finish_time":"2026-02-03T02:39:26.9684074Z","parent_msg_id":"2ccb62e5-8965-4961-9fbd-3fdbcf3f8003"},"text/plain":"StatementMeta(, 0b273384-f17d-4752-99bf-512d72b5e0f6, 4, Finished, Available, Finished)"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"application/vnd.synapse.sparksql-result+json":{"schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"name":"table_name","type":"string","nullable":false,"metadata":{}},{"name":"distinct_keys","type":"long","nullable":false,"metadata":{}},{"name":"total_rows","type":"long","nullable":false,"metadata":{}}]},"data":[["dim_date","5475","5475"],["dim_customer","99441","99441"],["dim_product","32951","32951"],["dim_seller","3095","3095"],["dim_order","99441","99441"],["dim_payment","5","28"]]},"text/plain":"<Spark SQL result set with 6 rows and 3 fields>"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":2,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"sparksql","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"collapsed":false},"id":"4c93f4b0-c77a-4827-81f6-6e97e181fc8f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["-- =========================\n","-- Validation for Dim Tables\n","-- =========================\n","\n","SELECT 'dim_customer -
