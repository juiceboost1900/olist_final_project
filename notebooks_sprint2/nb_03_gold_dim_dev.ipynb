{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Gold Layer (Sprint 2) – Dimension Development (dim_*)\n","\n","## Purpose\n","This notebook builds the Gold **dimension tables** for Sprint 2’s star schema.\n","These dimensions are designed to support BI joins and filtering while keeping the fact table at the correct grain.\n","\n","## Gold Layer Guardrails (Sprint 2)\n","\n","- Gold notebooks must read **promoted Silver tables only** via:\n","  - `silver_shortcut.sl_*`\n","- Gold notebooks must **NOT** read from:\n","  - `sl_dev_*`\n","- Gold notebooks must **NOT** write back to Silver.\n","\n","This guardrail ensures Gold development and validation are based on\n","stable, promoted Silver data only, even though `sl_dev_*` tables may\n","still be visible via schema shortcuts during development.\n","\n","## Inputs (Read-only)\n","- Source of truth is **promoted Silver tables only** (NOT sl_dev_*).\n","- Read from Silver via OneLake shortcut:\n","  - `silver_shortcut.sl_orders`\n","  - `silver_shortcut.sl_sellers`\n","  - (and other required `sl_*` tables as needed)\n","\n","## Outputs (Written to Gold)\n","- `dim_date`\n","- `dim_seller`\n","\n","## Expected Grain\n","- `dim_date`: 1 row per `order_date` (date key)\n","- `dim_seller`: 1 row per `seller_id`\n","\n","## Rules / Guardrails\n","- Do not write to Silver.\n","- Do not read from `sl_dev_*`.\n","- Do not perform fact-level aggregations here.\n","- Dimensions should be stable and reusable by multiple facts.\n","\n","## Completion Criteria\n","- `dim_date` and `dim_seller` are created successfully in Gold.\n","- Keys are unique (no duplicates).\n","- Columns required by BI are present and well-named.\n","\n","## Handoff\n","Once completed, Janson will use `nb_03_gold_star_dev_validation` to validate:\n","- dimension uniqueness\n","- join behavior with fact (no exploding joins)\n","- BI readiness\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"9b975369-29b3-498b-bfae-de389ddd1c28"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%sql\n","--
