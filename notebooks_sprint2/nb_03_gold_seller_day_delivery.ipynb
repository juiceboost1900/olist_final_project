{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Gold Mart – Seller × Day Performance (Sprint 1)\n","\n","## Purpose\n","This notebook builds the **Gold-level fact table**  \n","`gold_seller_daily_perf` at **seller × day grain**.\n","\n","This table is the **single source of truth for analytics** in Sprint 1 and\n","is directly consumed by:\n","- The semantic model\n","- Power BI dashboards\n","\n","The table name, grain, and schema are **stable across sprints**.\n","Business logic inside the table may evolve, but downstream consumers\n","must not need to rewire.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Grain Definition\n","**One row = one seller on one calendar day**\n","\n","\n","This grain supports:\n","- Seller performance comparison\n","- Daily trend analysis\n","- Delivery and customer satisfaction KPIs\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Source Tables (Sprint 1)\n","This Gold mart is built from **Stub Silver tables**:\n","\n","- `sl_stub_orders`\n","- `sl_stub_order_items`\n","- `sl_stub_reviews`\n","\n","These tables act as **schema contracts** for Sprint 1.\n","In later sprints, the Gold mart will be rebuilt from finalized Silver tables\n","(`sl_*`) without changing its schema or grain.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Key Metrics Produced\n","- Total orders per seller per day\n","- Total items sold\n","- Revenue and GMV (including freight)\n","- Average delivery days\n","- Late delivery indicator (seller-day level)\n","- Average review score\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Design Principles\n","- **Contract-first:** schema and grain stability over perfect logic\n","- **Idempotent:** safe to overwrite on each run\n","- **Analytics-ready:** Gold is the only layer exposed to BI\n","- **Minimal coupling:** downstream layers do not depend on Silver internals\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Notes for Contributors\n","- Do **not** change the table name `gold_seller_daily_perf`\n","- Do **not** change grain or column names without team agreement\n","- Development or experimental logic should be built in separate\n","  dev tables (e.g. `gold_dev_seller_daily_perf`) and promoted deliberately\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Downstream Usage\n","This table is consumed by:\n","- Power BI semantic model\n","- Sprint 1 demo dashboards\n","- Future automated Fabric pipelines\n","\n","Changes here have direct impact on reporting.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"sparksql","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"1b5c9505-2a9a-4375-9250-f386b3e8d6cb"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["CREATE
